# Pac-Man
We are working on a project to recreate the 1980 arcade game "Pac-Man" originally developed and published by Namco, as a tribute to the classic. This initiative is undertaken by two students from CITM - UPC in Terrassa, Spain.

## About the game

Pac-Man released in 1980 by Namco, is a classic arcade game where players control Pac-Man, a yellow character who must eat all the dots in a maze while avoiding four ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Eating Power Pellets makes the ghosts temporarily edible. 

The goal is to clear levels by eating all the dots, with the ghosts becoming faster and more aggressive as the game progresses. 

"Pac-Man" is famous for its addictive gameplay and iconic sound effects.
